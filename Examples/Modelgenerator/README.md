# How to use:
To generate the model described in C22_basic_queueing_system.slx, the following command is executed:
model_generator("C22_basic_queueing_system.slx", "C22_basic_queueing_system", "NSA_DEVS_LIB.slx");

The out directory contains all generated data build functions, including build_ C22_basic_queueing_system.

Via the script run_C22_basic_queueing_system the model is built, executed and evaluated.
