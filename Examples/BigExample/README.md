# NSA-DEVSforMATLAB BigExample

This is the example from the article: Modeling and Simulation of a Real-world Application using NSA-DEVS (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376651034_Modeling_and_Simulation_of_a_Real-world_Application_using_NSA-DEVS)

The runTest... functions are used to test the subcomponents.
The entire production line can be executed using the runProductionLine function.
The submodels are contained in ProductionLineLib.slx and the atomics folder contains special atomic models.
